Hi Raza,

I hope this message finds you well.  The following are instructions for assignment #4.

All files are in the Mustache-Template-HC repo, in the 04-assignment directory.

Just like the last two assignments, for this assignment, please produce a single HTML file and all of the supporting image files.

This assignment is fairly straightforward, except for one important element: the images of the friends.  The number of friends being displayed for each individual email will vary, therefore we need you to create a "grouping" for each of the friend elements (Date, White Line, Picture, and Name) in a way where the code is repeatable for each friend.  We will take care of all of the logic and looping, we just need you to produce the HTML in a way so that it can be repeated for each friend.  Although the PSD file contains 8 friends, please only create one row of 5 friends (i.e. don't worry about the 2nd row with 3 firends).

Another important lesson that we learned during the last assignment was that the "background" attribute of the <td> element is not supported in several very popular email clients like Outlook. In order to gracefully handle such clients, please be sure to always include the "bgcolor" attribute with all <td> elements that also contain the background attribute.  I have included the final version of the last assignment so that you can see what we eventually used.

Finally, the Birthday Emails.pdf file identifies all of the hyperlinks within the application.

Please let me know if you have any questions and when you think you can complete this assignment.

Thanks,

John
